## Getting started

To get started with the web application follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- If you are contributing code: Add [Biome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome) VSCode extension.
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)

### Installation

```bash
bun install
```

### Building and running

**Note:** Use this if you are testing the application. If you are developing the application use the development section below.

```bash
bun run build
```

The default build excludes the vendored TradingView Advanced Charts library's JavaScript and static assets. Advanced chart widgets display an unavailable message with chart exports and Copilot data disabled. The separately hosted TradingView widgets remain available.

To include the vendored library:

```bash
npm run build:with-tradingview
```

The build-time flag also works with other build modes:

```bash
VITE_TRADINGVIEW_ENABLED=true npm run build:runtime
```

The library is included when `VITE_TRADINGVIEW_ENABLED=true`. Changing this flag requires a rebuild. The flag also applies to the development server.

```bash
bun run preview
```

This will start the web application on `http://localhost:4173`.

## Development

To start the web application:

```bash
bun run dev # or yarn dev, pnpm dev, npm dev
```

This will start the web application in development mode on `http://localhost:1420`.

### Adding Icons

Workflow to add icons to the project:

1. Get the SVG source:

   - Option A: Export the icon from Figma - Right click on the icon and copy the SVG
   - Option B: Get the icon from [icones.js.org](https://icones.js.org/)

2. Convert the SVG to a sprite symbol:

   - [https://sprite-your-svgs.vercel.app/](https://sprite-your-svgs.vercel.app/) is recommended
   - Paste the SVG into the app
   - Choose an icon slug (e.g., 'bar-chart' for a bar chart icon). you need to make sure the slug is unique (see `app/components/sprite.svg` for existing slugs)
   - Click convert to optimize the SVG and create a symbol
   - Copy the generated symbol

3. Add to sprite file:

   - Open `app/components/sprite.svg`
   - Paste the generated symbol from step 2 inside the `<svg>` tag

4. Run the script to update the `Icon` type:

   - `bun run update-icons`

5. Use the icon:

   - Use the component with the slug name you chose:

   ```jsx
   <Icon id="bar-chart" className="w-4 h-4" />
   ```

This approach keeps icons optimized and easy to manage while maintaining a single sprite file for better performance.

## Special things to remember

- We overrode data-tooltip-delay in the TV files in the lib and assets folder - if grabbing new version need to do this again - 1.5s is too long
- TV classnames may also change, so every time we update TV we need to check the classnames match our selectors
- Custom class names prefixed with underscore (e.g., `_copy-chart-data-button`) are used to mark HTML elements for easy identification in selectors and testing. The underscore prefix indicates these are developer-defined classes rather than framework or library classes.

## Testing

We follow a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** approach. See [TESTING.md](./TESTING.md) for the complete testing guide including patterns, examples, and best practices.

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Unit tests (Vitest)
bun run test:unit                    # Run all unit tests
bun run test:unit -- --coverage      # Run with coverage report
bunx vitest tests/unit                # Run in watch mode

# Integration tests
bun run test:integration

# E2E tests (Playwright)
bun run test:e2e                     # Run local browser tests
bun run playwright test tests/e2e --ui   # Run with interactive UI
```

See [the browser test setup](tests/e2e/README.md) for backend dependencies, Chromium installation, and deployment URLs.
