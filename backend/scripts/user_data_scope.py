"""Declarative scope for the user data export/import.

This module is the single source of truth for *what moves* when a user's account
is exported from OpenBB Hub and imported into OpenBB Lite. Both
``scripts.export_user_data`` and ``scripts.import_user_data`` read this list, so
the two sides cannot drift apart.

Two registries, both deliberate:

``INCLUDED``
    Tables that are exported, in the order they must be inserted on import
    (SQLite runs with ``PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON``, so order is load-bearing).

``EXCLUDED``
    User-linked tables that are *not* exported, each with the reason. Excluded
    is a decision, not an oversight -- anything user-linked belongs in one list
    or the other, and ``test_user_data_scope.py`` fails if a table is in
    neither.

Run ``python -m scripts.user_data_scope`` to print the scope as a table.
